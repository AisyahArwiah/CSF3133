This project was created as part of my Web-Based Interface Design course. The purpose was to design and implement a user-friendly and interactive web interface that demonstrates the principles we learned in class, including layout design, usability, and visual appeal.

By working on this project, I practiced organizing information clearly, designing interactive components, and enhancing the overall user experience. The project allowed me to explore how design decisions, such as button placement, animations, and content visibility, affect usability and user engagement.

Overall, this project reflects my effort to apply theoretical concepts from Web-Based Interface Design into a practical web application, helping me develop skills in creating functional, accessible, and visually appealing interfaces.
